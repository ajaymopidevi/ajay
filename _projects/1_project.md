Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful imaging technique used to study the three-dimensional (3D) cellular components and macromolecular complexes in their near-native state, providing insights into their organization and interactions. The data acquired can be noisy, and the sample may undergo distortions during the imaging process. 

Using Machine Learning techniques U-Ney and Autoencoder, we are able to successly segment the cellular structures like ribosome, membrane, microtubules, filament.

<h2> Future Work</h2>
You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
