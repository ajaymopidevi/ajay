I am 2nd year Research based Master's student in Computer Science as University of Colorado Boulder. I am highly interested the fields of Computer Vision and Robotics and fascinated by the potential of fully autonomous systems. 

With the Autonomous and Robotics Perception Group (ARPG) at CU Boulder, I am currently working on integrating the vast prior information inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) e.g., GPT-4 and make the robots understand where to go  from a userâ€™s instruction. My contributions to this project at ARPG have directly led to a co-authorship on a natural language-based robotics navigation <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09523.pdf">paper</a>, currently under review at CoRL. 

In addition to my work in visual language navigation, I am also working on radar-based navigation and mapping to enable the perception systems to function properly even in extreme weather conditions like smoke, fog etc. Even though radar sensors are proven to be effective in these environments, they pose additional challenges like sparse data representations and multi-path reflections. I am currently focusing my research efforts on developing advanced deep learning architectures, e.g., transformers to mitigate these challenges and enable the radar perception algorithms equally as capable as lidar perception.

I am also working with Kasinath's lab at CU Boulder to segment the cellular structures like <a href="_projects/1_project">ribosomes, membrane, micro-tubules, filaments</a> from the Cryo-ET tomogram. Cryo Electron Tomography combines cryogenic sample preparation, electron microscopy and computational image analysis to visualize the internal cellular structures and macro-molecules in their native state. Limiting the annotaions to <1% of entire images, we used machine learning techniques like Auto-encoders and U-Net to segment these structures.
