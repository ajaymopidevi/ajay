I am 2nd year Research based Master's student in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder. I am highly interested the fields of Computer Vision and Robotics and fascinated by the potential of fully autonomous systems. 


With the <a href="https://arpg.github.io/">Autonomous and Robotics Perception Group (ARPG)</a> at CU Boulder, I am currently working on integrating the vast prior information inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) e.g., GPT-4 and enabling the robots to understand where to go  from a userâ€™s instruction. My contributions to this project at ARPG have directly led to 2 co-authored publications on a natural language-based robotics navigation, currently under review at <a href="https://www.corl2023.org/">CoRL</a> and <a href="https://iser2023.org/">ISER</a>.

In addition to my work in visual language navigation, I am also working on radar-based navigation and mapping to enable the perception systems to function properly even in extreme weather conditions like smoke, fog etc. Even though radar sensors are proven to be effective in these environments, they pose additional challenges like sparse data representations and multi-path reflections. <a href="https://ajaymopidevi.github.io/ajay/projects/2_project/">My current contributions</a> have been submitted to <a href="http://ieee-icra.org/">ICRA</a> and currently under review.

I am also working with <a href="http://cryoem.colorado.edu/">Kasinath's lab</a> at CU Boulder to segment the cellular structures like <a href="projects/1_project">ribosomes, membrane, micro-tubules, filaments</a> from the Cryo-ET tomogram. Cryo Electron Tomography combines cryogenic sample preparation, electron microscopy and computational image analysis to visualize the internal cellular structures and macro-molecules in their native state. Limiting the annotaions to <1% of entire images, we used machine learning techniques like Auto-encoders and U-Net to segment these structures.

Before pursuing my master's degree, I was part of Samsung's Advanced Multimedia Solutions team in the Camera division. There, I focused on developing computer vision algorithms, combining traditional and deep-learning approaches, to enhance the performance and accuracy of Samsung Camera sensors. A significant accomplishment was my work on real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms utilizing only range data from ToF sensors.
