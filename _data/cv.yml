    - title: Computer Vision Research Engineer 
      institution: Samsung Semiconductord India R&D, Bangalore, India
      year: Jul 2020 - Jul 2022
      description:
        - Developed 3D scene reconstruction algorithm with only the depth-data from ToF sensors, achieving a real-time processing speed of 20fps
        - Automated the alignment of output 3D scene with groundtruth and improved the accuracy by 5% by detecting and removing outliers
        - Optimized Samsung’s CMOS camera sensor noise reduction algorithm with OpenMP parallel programming, thereby reducing the algorithm runtime by 33%
        - Reduced the latency of Remosaic deep learning models for 200M pixel camera sensor using quantization and pruning techniques by 10 % with an unnoticeable degradation of 0.1% in perceptual quality
    - title: Software Engineer
      institution: Qualcomm, Bangalore, India
      year: Aug 2017 - Jun 2020
      description:
        - Spearheaded the development and maintenance of python audio library to evaluate both the objective and perceptual audio quality of the Bluetooth headsets
        - Enhanced python automated test framework with new features that populate test vectors and visualize audio output signals, leading to a 10%-15% reduction in both the validation and development teams’ efforts
